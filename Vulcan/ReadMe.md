**Vulcan**, as the Greek god from which it gets it's name, is a plugin that repairs your gear via Mendors. It's intended to be used on characters that don't have access to self repair or would other wise not want to use Lisbeth to do repair. Set the threashold for repairs in the settings and it'll find the nearest mednor in it's database when that threshold is reached.
